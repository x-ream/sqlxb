release: v1.2.3 - CTE & UNION fluent builders

🎯 Core Theme: Composable SQL pipelines without leaving BuilderX

✨ New Capabilities:
1. Common Table Expressions
   - `With(name, fn)` & `WithRecursive(name, fn)` for multi-stage query setup
   - Automatic alias normalization and parameter propagation
   - Regression coverage via `with_cte_test.go`

2. UNION chaining
   - `UNION(kind, fn)` with `ALL()` helper (default = DISTINCT)
   - Stack multiple unions while preserving ORDER BY / LIMIT semantics
   - New tests ensure DISTINCT/ALL correctness

3. Metadata injection
   - `Meta(func(meta *interceptor.Metadata))` enables inline TraceID/Tenant setup
   - Interceptors receive enriched metadata prior to Build()

🔧 Internal Improvements:
- Shared SQL core writer now feeds both base SELECT and UNION branches
- `DISTINCT` constant renamed to `DISTINCT_SCRIPT` to avoid helper collision
- Builder states cache CTE / UNION clauses to avoid duplicate builds

📖 Documentation:
- README updated with v1.2.3 highlight section, CTE/UNION examples, metadata usage
- CHANGELOG、Release Notes、Test Report 全面同步

🧪 Quality:
- `go test ./...` ✅ (~240 cases including new suites)
- No breaking changes; existing APIs continue to work unchanged

🚀 Summary:
v1.2.3 brings enterprise-grade analytics features—CTEs, recursive hierarchies, UNION composition, and observability—while keeping the fluent builder experience intact.
