# LlamaIndex Integration (English)

Brief translation of `xb/doc/ai_application/LLAMAINDEX_INTEGRATION.md`.

## Tips

- Implement a custom retriever that calls xb and feeds results into LlamaIndex nodes.
- Use metadata filters in xb to mirror LlamaIndex metadata queries.
- Cache xb payloads if your LlamaIndex graph frequently reuses them.

Refer to `doc/en/AI_APPLICATION.md` for end-to-end examples.
