# AI Application Quickstart (English)

Translation of `xb/doc/ai_application/QUICKSTART.md`. It walks through wiring xb into an AI stack (embeddings → vector DB → LLM).

---

## Pipeline

1. Chunk and embed documents.
2. Store vectors + metadata.
3. Use xb to query SQL/vector sources.
4. Feed results to your LLM (RAG, agent, analytics).

See `doc/en/AI_APPLICATION.md` for code snippets covering each step.
